OK, we haven't been asked these questions. Instead, they are speculative
questions that we think others might have, but _actual_ questions will be added
here over time. This is also a convenient format to talk about what this site is
about in more detail.

## The Brands we List

### What does "built to last" mean?

This is different from category to category; for something like bakeware you
might expect it to outlive you. For clothing, it might depend on the piece and
the use. "Built to last" means: not built to fail, and made as reasonably and
robustly as one could expect for its given use. That explanation is a bit of a
cop-out, but also you probably know what we mean.

### What does "reasonable labor laws" mean?

This one is tricky, but the ethos behind this site is: we think the people that
make the things we buy should have as many opportunities as we do, and be
treated as well as we are.

You can write a _lot_ about what's "reasonable". You could argue that even in
countries with relatively strong labor laws people aren't treated as fairly and
paid as well as they should be. And frankly we'd agree with you. But also we do
what we can with what we have.

### What does "priced for quality, not for luxury" mean?

You can buy _very expensive_ clothing that will only last for several wears. You
can buy extraordinarily complex, adorned, extravagant items which don't perform
appreciably better. You can buy goods where you are paying for the logo more
than the product, and this tends to go hand in hand with the people who actually
made the item not being paid well for their work.

We aren't here to list things that are "cheap", by any stretch. Some of them
could be quite expensive even. But the goal is for these items to be _worth_ the
cost, because they work well and last for you, and the people that made them
were taken care of.

### How do you know these brands treat people fairly?

We don't. And you are absolutely encouraged to do your own research to see how
you feel about the products you buy on a case by case basis.

### These items are expensive, I can get the same quality for less elsewhere!

Then by all means do; this site is about a specific set of criteria we want to
evaluate when choosing goods, and it doesn't necessarily mean they are better,
nor does it mean our criteria are better. They're just our criteria, and this
site exists because finding brands that fit them wasn't easily discoverable.

## General

### I'd like to make a similar site, but with a different focus.

Awesome. We've documented exactly how this site is built in our [Contribution
Guide], and you can fork what we've done to create your own. It's technical, but
in the end it can be done for just the cost of a domain name (and your time of
course, which isn't cheap!). We'd love to see similar guides pop up.
