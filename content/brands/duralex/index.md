Duralex is a manufacturer of glassware; they specialize in drinkware and
dinnerware, and is known for its robustness. All of their glassware is made in
France, and can be bought direct from their USA distribution.

In 2021 they were purchased by [Pyrex][], but while sharing a name with the
American Pyrex (owned by Corning), Pyrex EU appears to be a different company.
