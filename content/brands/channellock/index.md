Channellock is a tool manufacturer, probably best known for their
channel-locking pliers. They offer a variety of gripping tools, made in the USA.

Unfortunately not all of their products are USA-made, but those that are carry
a prominent label. Those that are not do not denote their origin in an obvious
manner.
