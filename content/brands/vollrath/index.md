Vollrath is a cookware and bakeware company, focused on commercial kitchen. A
substantial portion of their goods are made in the USA, including their "Jacob's
Pride" line of clad cookware which is relatively inexpensive vs other clad
lines.

While Vollrath doesn't sell directly to consumers, their goods are carried by
[WebstaurantStore][] which lists a prominent "Made in USA" badge on relevant
products.
