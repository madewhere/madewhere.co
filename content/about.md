description: About us, and the products we list.

madewhere is a website dedicated to specific types of goods; those that are:

* Built to last
* Made in countries with reasonable labor laws
* Priced for their quality, not for luxury

There is also a special nod—and occasionally some concessions—for products which
are:

* Eco-friendly in manufacture or packaging
* Employee owned

This site is meant as a database to locate these goods and discover their
pitfalls; just because some products from a particular brand fill these
requirements it does not mean _all_ do, and companies change their practices all
the time. Nor are any of the above bullets particularly well defined—and
certainly their definitions and merits can be debated—but hopefully the contents
provide a reasonable starting point for you to make your own decisions on these
matters.
